## About Me

My acquaintance with programming started with entering BSUIR. I studied my preferences concerning different spheres of programming and computer languages. And after the work my choice fell on JS because of it's prospects and possibility of checking the intermediate result.

## Code example
**Description of the KATA from CODEWARS**: A pangram is a sentence that contains every single letter of the alphabet at least once. For example, the sentence "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog" is a pangram, because it uses the letters A-Z at least once (case is irrelevant).


Given a string, detect whether or not it is a pangram. Return True if it is, False if not. Ignore numbers and punctuation.
```
function isPangram(string){
  return 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'
    .split('')
    .every((x) => string.toLowerCase().includes(x));
}
```
